# Intro

Hey everyone, my name's Yanna! I’m attending the University of Florida, studying Computer Science with a minor in Digital Arts and Sciences. I'm also currently an undergraduate researcher with the [INDIE Lab](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~eragan/indie.html) and an incoming Summer 2023 SWE intern for American Express.

I'm passionate about building both useful and well-designed tools that help improve people's lives. I strive to be empathetic and compassionate, taking into account how both users and our environment might be affected by the things I build, and be conscious of sustainable software practices.

If you have any questions, please free to reach out to me!
